    """Draw ordering among candidates of EQUAL difficulty.

    A tie-break never trades against training utility — difficulty ranks first,
    so this only orders submissions already judged equally useful. The question
    is which tie-break does least harm, and ordering by arrival round actively
    penalises long generation: a 16k-token rollout arrives later than a 500-token
    one and loses the slot at identical hardware. With binary rewards the
    difficulty score takes only nine values, so equal-difficulty ties are common,
    not marginal — the penalty applies broadly.

    Ordering by tokens-per-round is length-NEUTRAL: at equal hardware a long
    completion ranks the same as a short one. ``token_cap`` bounds the numerator
    so generating past the useful budget earns no rank, and because throughput is
    a rate rather than a total, padding adds tokens and time in step.

    INCOMPATIBLE WITH SPECULATIVE EARLY CLOSE. Sealing a window before its
    deadline requires that a leading candidate can no longer be overtaken, which
    held under arrival ordering — arriving later meant ranking later, full stop.
    Throughput ordering breaks that: a submission arriving later can still
    outrank an earlier one by serving faster, so leadership is not decided until
    the deadline. Proving mid-window would spend the bounded proof wall on
    candidates that later lose. (The final tiebreak also draws on seal randomness,
    which does not exist until the seal.) Dominance would only be provable for a
    candidate at both the value ceiling AND the maximum attainable throughput
    bucket, which is too rare to build a mechanism on. If early close is ever
    reconsidered, one of the two has to go.
