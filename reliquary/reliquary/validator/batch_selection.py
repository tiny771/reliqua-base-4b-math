"""Drand-round-anchored batch selection + emission distribution (design A').

Called once per window at seal time. Two things happen here:

1. **Pick the B distinct prompts that go into the training step.** Order is
   driven by the drand round each miner attached at submit time. Submissions
   are bucketed into 3-second slots (one drand quicknet round per slot);
   earlier slots fill the batch first. Within a slot, distinct prompts are
   admitted in a canonical hash order so two validators with different
   in-memory orderings still agree.

2. **Compute the emission distribution.** Each filled slot is worth
   ``pool / B``. Within a slot, the K miners who submitted for that
   ``(round, prompt)`` split that share equally. So a miner sybiling the
   same prompt with N hotkeys in the same drand round earns N × (1/N) =
   identical total payout to a single hotkey — registration costs make
   sybiling strictly wasteful.

Unfilled slots burn their share (no redistribution). This keeps emission
math simple and stable; partial fills happen when miner activity is low,
and the burn appears in the on-chain weight setter as missing weight for
that window.

v2.3+: replaces the v2.2 pure-FIFO ``select_batch``.

            windows burn unused share rather than redistributing).

          × pool, with unfilled slots burned.

    Boundary-round fair split
    -------------------------
    When iterating rounds in ascending order, the round that first brings
    ``len(training_batch)`` past ``b`` is the "boundary round". Earlier
    code stopped the moment ``b`` was reached, which meant: within the
    boundary round, only the prompts with the smallest canonical hashes
    got slots, and every other miner in that same drand-3-s bucket
    earned zero. That's unfair — those miners arrived at the same
    chronological tier; the canonical hash is just a tiebreaker, not a
    priority.

    The boundary round now distributes its share fairly across ALL
    prompts in it:

      per_prompt_boundary = remaining_slots × slot_share / N_prompts_in_round
      per_miner_on_prompt = per_prompt_boundary / K_p

    Total emission paid in the boundary round equals
    ``remaining_slots × slot_share`` (= exactly what the boundary round
    is "worth"). The training batch still trains on
    ``remaining_slots`` prompts (canonical hash order) — that's just an
    implementation cap on training cost, not an economic statement.

    Sybil invariants preserved:
      * Same-prompt sybil neutral: K hotkeys on one prompt split the
        per_prompt share K-way, total payout per prompt is fixed
        independent of K.
      * Different-prompt sybil tax: K hotkeys on K different prompts in
        the boundary round each earn per_prompt_boundary, registration
        burn is the tax.
      * Conservation: total reward paid in boundary round equals what
        a full non-boundary round would have paid for the same slot
        count.
