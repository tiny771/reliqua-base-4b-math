r"""Structural validity of a rollout's final boxed/fboxed answer.

The OMI reward scores the LAST ``\boxed{...}`` / ``\fbox{...}`` in the
completion. A reward=0 rollout whose final box is malformed (empty,
special-token, or unclosed) did not produce a parseable answer — it is a "fake
negative" used to manufacture a group reward vector (k=4 / sigma=0.5) that
passes the zone filter. Examples: appending ``\boxed{<|im_end|>`` after a
correct ``\boxed{121}``, an empty ``\boxed{}``, or spamming boxes to the token
cap so the final one is cut off.

This check is purely structural and aligned with what the env scores (the last
box): it does NOT compare to the ground truth and does NOT judge intent. A
well-formed final box that is simply wrong is a legitimate negative and is not
flagged here (forced wrong answers are covered by the boxed-answer probability
check). Pure, side-effect-free; called by the batcher before GRAIL.
