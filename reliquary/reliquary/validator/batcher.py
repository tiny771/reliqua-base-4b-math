        ``t_arrival`` is the wall-clock time at which the request was
        received by the validator's HTTP server (stamped by the ASGI
        ``stamp_arrival`` middleware in ``server.py``). When provided, it
        is used to compute the "current" round instead of ``time.time()``
        at call time. This decouples the round check from validator-side
        processing latency: if the asyncio loop stalls for N seconds
        (trainer GIL contention, GRAIL queue backpressure, pydantic body
        parsing on the loop), a submission that arrived at the validator
        within its round is still accepted, because the round is computed
        as of the arrival timestamp, not as of when the handler finally
        runs. Without this, an honest submission that landed inside its
        round can become STALE_ROUND purely because the validator was
        busy when the handler executed.

        Falls back to ``self._wall_clock()`` if ``t_arrival`` is None
        (e.g. the worker-path re-check inside ``_accept_locked`` called
        directly, tests that don't go through the HTTP layer).

        Forward direction is zero-tolerance: a miner that attaches round
        R+1 hasn't seen σ_{R+1} yet (σ_R is the freshest signed beacon by
        definition), so claiming a future round is unrecoverable cheating
        and always rejected as FUTURE_ROUND.

        Backward direction allows only the configured
        ``self.drand_round_backward_tolerance``. Production sets this to zero.
        Auction ranking does not use the submitted round, and large body
        transport is handled by signed precommit/reveal: the small precommit's
        arrival fixes the drand observation before upload. Widening tolerance
        therefore weakens freshness without solving the transport problem.

        Public so the HTTP /submit handler can run it pre-queue and
        short-circuit the rejection without waiting on the worker.

        """Prove strict auction winners until ``B_BATCH`` distinct prompts pass.

        Difficulty remains primary and validator-observed precommit drand round
        remains secondary. Exact ties use post-deadline drand bound only to the
        checkpoint, window, environment, operator and prompt. Hotkeys and miner
        payload fields cannot mint extra tie tickets. If seal drand is
        unavailable, exact validator-observed precommit arrival is the explicit
        liveness fallback; known window randomness is never an economic salt.

        A prompt is claimed only after a submission passes proof. A fabricated
        leader therefore fails without squatting the prompt, and the next
        strictly ranked candidate is promoted. Proving stops immediately after
        eight distinct winners; no boundary tier is expanded for payout.

        Bounds (spec §2.3): per-hotkey and per-operator failure skips cap a
        single identity even when one coldkey owns many hotkeys, and a global
        attempt ceiling
        (``MAX_RANKED_PROOF_ATTEMPTS_PER_WINDOW``) caps a
        multi-hotkey flood so proving can never exceed the graded pool. On
        exhaustion we log, stop, and advance with the shortfall (fewer than
        ``B_BATCH`` in ``_valid``); the training path already burns unpaid slots.

        Runs OUTSIDE ``_lock``: ``_verify_expensive`` is 5-25 s of GPU per
        candidate, mutates reject state, and is not thread-safe, so the loop is
        strictly serial.
