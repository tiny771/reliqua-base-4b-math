# Per-hotkey cap on BAD_ENVELOPE_SIGNATURE rejects per window. The

# cannot drain a victim's legitimate quota by spamming bogus packets
# under the victim's hotkey — that anti-DoS property is preserved.
#
# This cap closes a follow-on side-channel discovered in the wild: the
# zero-quota bad-envelope channel was being used by the LEGITIMATE
# hotkey owner to warm HTTP/1.1 keep-alive connections at zero quota
# cost (fire ~24 bogus POSTs to prime sockets, then ride the warm
# connections for the real signed POSTs and gain a ~20-30 ms RTT edge
# on the seal-trigger race against honest single-instance miners).
#
# Two defences combine in the fix:
#   1. ``Connection: close`` is set on every BAD_ENVELOPE_SIGNATURE
#      response, so the warm-up cannot happen (server tears the socket
#      down immediately; attacker pays handshake on the next packet).
#   2. This per-hotkey cap bounds bandwidth and verdict-ring noise even
#      against an attacker who doesn't care about priming — past the cap
#      the response is still BAD_ENVELOPE_SIGNATURE but the verdict is
#      no longer appended to the per-hotkey ring (which would otherwise
#      let a spoofer flood the victim's ``/verdicts/{hotkey}`` history
#      with junk that displaces legitimate entries).
#
# Crucially the per-hotkey rate-limit quota is never moved by these
# rejects, so PR #35's invariant holds end-to-end: an anonymous spoofer
# firing N bad packets against victim V's hotkey writes at most
# ``MAX_BAD_ENVELOPE_PER_HOTKEY_PER_WINDOW`` verdict-ring entries and
# burns N handshakes, but V's full legitimate quota is untouched.

# Conservative valuation of truncated rollouts (closes the manufactured-zero
# hole). The auction pays more for HARD prompts (value peaks at low k), so a
# miner can inflate a prompt's value by breaking one of its own correct
# rollouts: suppressing EOS runs it to max_tokens, where it grades 0 and the
# prompt looks harder. Measured on the live value function, one manufactured
# zero at k=6 is worth +68%. GPU tests showed this is NOT reliably detectable —
# an EOS-suppressed rollout looks like honest rambling, and any detector is
# farmable (a miner retries prompts until one evades).
#
# So price it instead of policing it: a truncated rollout has no gradeable
# answer, and the validator cannot know whether it would have been correct, so
# the group is valued under the interpretation LEAST favourable to the miner
# (min over "j of the truncated were actually correct", j = 0..t). The true
# outcome is always one of those interpretations, so a manipulated group can
# never score above its honest value — verified exhaustively over every
# (k, truncated-correct, truncated-wrong) combination: 0 profitable cases.
# Cost: an honestly-rambling group is also valued down, worst at high k (easy
# prompts, already near-worthless) and mildest at low k (−7% at k=2), which is

#
# Why zero is safe now
# --------------------
# The two reasons the tolerance was widened in earlier iterations are
# both eliminated by the v2.3 fixes on this branch:
#
#   * Worker-side dequeue lag (PR #31 → tol=10). The seal/drand re-check
#     used to run on the worker, minutes after arrival under GRAIL queue
#     backpressure. Removed by the arrival-time refactor — drand is now
#     checked only once at HTTP arrival, against the middleware-stamped
#     ``t_arrival``.
#   * RTT boundary crossing (commit 8b7f483 → tol=1). A miner firing at
#     t=2.99 s of round R would land at the validator at t=3.00 s of
#     R+1. Well-behaved miners are expected to apply a small boundary-
#     safety margin client-side and sleep past the boundary if their
#     corrected clock is within a few hundred ms of one. With both
#     sides NTP-synced and the miner respecting the safety window, no
#     honest submission should land in the wrong drand round.
#
# Submitted drand no longer participates in auction rank, but accepting an old
# round still weakens the signed freshness contract and makes replay analysis
# ambiguous. Keep this at zero. Cross-continent body upload is handled by the
# signed precommit/reveal grace, whose drand observation is fixed when the small
# precommit reaches the validator; widening this tolerance is not the transport
# fix.
# Tests pin specific values explicitly via
# ``GrpoWindowBatcher(drand_round_backward_tolerance=...)``.

# that attaches round R+1 hasn't seen σ_{R+1} yet, so they're cheating).
