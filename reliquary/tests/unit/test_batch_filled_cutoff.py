"""Tests for the BATCH_FILLED early-cutoff at HTTP + worker layers.

Once a batcher has sealed (B_BATCH distinct non-cooldown valid submissions
accepted), ``select_batch`` will pick those by ``arrived_at``. Further
submissions land strictly later in arrival order and therefore cannot
displace any of the already-selected entries.

Pre-fix, those late arrivals went through the full pipeline:
  * HTTP /submit queued them
  * Submit worker ran ~5–25 s of GRAIL forward pass per item
  * Result added to ``self._valid`` but never made it into the final batch

In production this caused the queue to grow into the TRAINING phase,
inflated the OPEN→TRAIN transition by 5–15 minutes on busy windows, and
burned ~30× the necessary GPU cycles when spammer hotkeys were active.

Post-fix:
  * HTTP /submit returns ``BATCH_FILLED`` the instant the batcher seals
  * The submit worker drops queue items it picks up after the seal,
    also as ``BATCH_FILLED``
  * Both paths invoke the existing late-drop callback so operators can
    measure the savings in R2 archives
