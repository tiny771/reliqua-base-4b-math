"""Conservative valuation of truncated rollouts — closes the manufactured-zero
hole in the difficulty auction.

The auction pays more for hard prompts, so breaking one of your own correct
rollouts (suppress EOS -> runs to the cap -> grades 0) makes a prompt look
harder and pays more. Scoring the minimum over every interpretation of the
truncated rollouts removes that gain entirely.
